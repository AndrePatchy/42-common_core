# 42 Common Core

The 42 Common Core was developed in Paris in 2013 and is continually evaluated and developed. Students progress through the program by completing projects and earning points to level up, making the learning experience feel like a game.

This repository contains code developed at 42 Lisbon Common Core, from 01/09/2023 to present day.

## Projects

### [Libft](https://github.com/AndrePatchy/42-common_core/tree/main/Libft)
Libft involves learning how the standard functions of C programming work by writing them from scratch and creating a personal library. This project is vital as the library will be used in future assignments at 42. You can find the subject [here](https://github.com/AndrePatchy/42-common_core/blob/main/Libft/Subject/en_subject_libft.pdf). 
In every project, I write down a few notes for mental model purposes. You can find the notes that helped me with the Libft project [here](https://github.com/AndrePatchy/42-common_core/blob/main/Libft/Support.txt).
